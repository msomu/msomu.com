				<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
				<p>By using the ToonGen app, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>

				<h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
				<p>To use the photo-to-cartoon conversion feature, users need to purchase a premium subscription.</p>

				<p>a. We offer two subscription models:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>$7.99 USD per month: This subscription provides premium access to our app for 1 week. The renewal price is the same.</li>
					<li>$29.99 USD per year: This subscription provides premium access to our app for 1 year. The renewal price is the same.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While premium users have unlimited access to the photo-to-cartoon conversion features, fair usage policies may apply. To ensure a high-quality experience for all users, rate limits may be implemented if usage significantly exceeds typical patterns. These limits are designed to be generous and should not impact regular usage.</p>

				<p>b. We reserve the right to change the pricing, subscription terms, or benefits associated with in-app purchases. Any such changes will be communicated through the app or on our website.</p>

				<h2>3. Usage Limitations</h2>
				<p>a. We reserve the right to limit the number of conversions and may change or terminate our services at any time.</p>

				<p>b. IMPORTANT: ToonGen is intended for creative and entertainment purposes only. The app's photo-to-cartoon conversion feature should NOT be relied upon for legal, financial, or professional advice. Users must exercise caution and verify information from credible sources when necessary.</p>

				<h2>5. Gemini AI API</h2>
				<p>We utilize the Gemini API to power some of our application's features. While we strive to provide the best service, we are not responsible for any errors, inaccuracies, or unavailability stemming from the Gemini API.</p>

				<p>Disclaimer: The photo-to-cartoon conversion results are generated by the Gemini API and may resemble existing cartoon styles or characters.
