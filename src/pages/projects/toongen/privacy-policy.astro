				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Welcome to ToonGen, developed by Somasundaram M. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you when you use our iOS application and related services.</p>

				<p>This privacy policy applies to the ToonGen app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Somasundaram M (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

				</ul>

				<p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>
