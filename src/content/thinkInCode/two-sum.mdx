## 📝 Problem Statement  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## 💡 My Initial Thought Process  
When I first approached this problem, I thought about using a **HashMap** to efficiently find the solution:

1. Iterate through each number in the array
2. For each number, calculate the difference between the target and the current number
3. Check if this difference exists in our HashMap
4. If it does, we've found our pair! Return the indices
5. If not, add the current number and its index to the HashMap and continue

This approach ensures we only need to go through the array once, giving us an **O(N)** time complexity.

## 🏆 My Initial Solution

<KotlinPlayground code={`
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        val hm = HashMap<Int, Int>()
        nums.forEachIndexed {index, v -> 
            val rem = target - v
            if(hm.contains(rem)){
                return intArrayOf(hm[rem]!!,index)
            }
            hm.put(v,index)
        }
        return intArrayOf()
    }
}
`} />

This solution works correctly and efficiently, but I felt there was room for improvement in terms of readability and Kotlin idioms.

## 🚀 Improved Solution with Kotlin Idioms

<KotlinPlayground code={`
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        val seen = HashMap<Int, Int>()
        nums.forEachIndexed {i, num ->
            seen[target - num]?.let { return intArrayOf(i, it) }
            seen[num] = i
        }
        return intArrayOf()
    }
}
`} />

## 🔥 What I Learned

Through this process, I picked up some valuable Kotlin idioms and best practices:

1. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Using `seen` instead of `hm` makes the code more readable and self-documenting.

2. **Safe Call with Let**: The `?.let` operator is a concise way to handle nullable values. Instead of:
   ```kotlin
   if(hm.contains(rem)){
       return intArrayOf(hm[rem]!!,index)
   }
   ```
   We can use:
   ```kotlin
   seen[target - num]?.let { return intArrayOf(i, it) }
   ```
   This eliminates the need for the null assertion operator (`!!`) and makes the code more elegant.

3. **Direct Map Access**: Instead of using `contains()` followed by a lookup, we can directly access the map with the safe call operator.

## ⏳ Time Complexity Analysis
- Building and searching the HashMap → O(N)
- Overall Complexity: O(N) 🚀 (Fast & Efficient!)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- The HashMap approach allows us to find the complement in O(1) time
- By storing each number as we go, we're essentially "remembering" what we've seen before
- This problem demonstrates how data structures can dramatically improve algorithm efficiency
