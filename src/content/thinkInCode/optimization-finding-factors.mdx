Today I decided to talk about time complexity and have chosen a very small, easy, direct problem - probably something you might have encountered in school. It's a perfect example to demonstrate how a simple mathematical insight can dramatically improve performance, turning what would be years of computation into mere seconds.

## üìù Problem Statement  
Finding all factors of a number is a common computational task. For a number N, we need to find all integers that divide N without a remainder.

For example:
- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (total: 6 factors)
- Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (total: 8 factors)

---

## üí° Our Initial Thought Process  
When first approaching this problem, the brute force solution seems obvious:

1. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to N
2. Check if each number divides N without a remainder
3. Count the total number of factors

This approach works, but what happens when N becomes extremely large?

```kotlin
fun countFactorsBruteForce(n: Int): Int {
    var count = 0
    for (i in 1..n) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

For a number like 10^18, this would take approximately 10^10 seconds, which is over **316 years**! Clearly, we need a better approach.

---

## ü§Ø Our Intuition & "Aha!" Moment  

We initially thought we could optimize by only checking up to N/2, but through a dry run, we realized this wasn't correct.

Let's see why with an example using N = 12:

| Number (i) | Is Factor? | Corresponding Pair (N/i) | Action with N/2 Approach | Action with ‚àöN Approach |
|------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1          | Yes        | 12                       | Count 1                  | Count 1 and 12          |
| 2          | Yes        | 6                        | Count 2                  | Count 2 and 6           |
| 3          | Yes        | 4                        | Count 3                  | Count 3 and 4           |
| 4          | Yes        | 3                        | Count 4                  | Already counted with 3  |
| 5          | No         | -                        | Skip                     | Skip (beyond ‚àö12)       |
| 6          | Yes        | 2                        | Count 6                  | Already counted with 2  |
| 7-11       | No         | -                        | Skip                     | Skip (beyond ‚àö12)       |
| 12         | Yes        | 1                        | Skip (beyond N/2)        | Already counted with 1  |

With the N/2 approach, we would only check numbers 1 through 6 and count each factor once. This gives us 4 factors (1, 2, 3, 6), missing 4 and 12.

With the ‚àöN approach, we only check numbers 1 through 3 (since ‚àö12 ‚âà 3.46), but for each factor i, we also count N/i as a factor. This correctly gives us all 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).

Then came the mathematical insight: **If i is a factor of N, then N/i is also a factor of N**.

This means:
- For every factor i < ‚àöN, there's a corresponding factor N/i > ‚àöN
- We only need to check numbers up to ‚àöN!

For example, with N = 12:
- 1 √ó 12 = 12
- 2 √ó 6 = 12
- 3 √ó 4 = 12

By checking only up to ‚àö12 ‚âà 3.46, we can find all factors!

## üèÜ Our Optimized Approach

### üîπ **Steps to Solve Efficiently**  
1. Iterate from 1 to ‚àöN
2. For each number i that divides N, count both i and N/i as factors
3. Handle the special case where i = ‚àöN (we should only count it once)

---

## üíª Code Implementation (Kotlin)  

<KotlinPlayground code={`
class Solution {
    fun countFactors(n: Int): Int {
        var count = 0
        var i = 1

        while (i * i <= n) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                // If i is a perfect square root of n, count it only once
                if (n / i == i) {
                    count += 1
                } else {
                    // Otherwise, count both i and n/i
                    count += 2
                }
            }
            i++
        }

        return count
    }
}
`} />

## üìä Measuring Execution Time

Let's measure the execution time for each approach individually to see the difference in performance.

### üî∏ Brute Force Approach

First, let's measure the execution time of the brute force approach:

<KotlinPlayground code={`
fun countFactorsBruteForce(n: Long): Int {
    var count = 0
    for (i in 1..n) {
        if (n % i == 0L) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}

fun main() {
    val testCases = listOf(12L, 24L, 1000000L)

    println("| Number    | Brute Force Time (s) | Factors |")
    println("|-----------|----------------------|---------|")

    for (n in testCases) {
        val startTime = System.nanoTime()
        val factorCount = countFactorsBruteForce(n)
        val endTime = System.nanoTime()

        val executionTime = String.format("%.6f", (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000_000.0)
        println("| %-9s | %-20s | %-7s |".format(n, executionTime, factorCount))
    }

    println("Note: For larger numbers like 10^9 or 10^18, this approach would take too long to complete.")
}
`} />

As we can see, even for a relatively small number like 1,000,000, the brute force approach takes a noticeable amount of time. For truly large numbers, it becomes impractical.

### üî∏ Optimized Approach

Now, let's measure the execution time of our optimized approach:

<KotlinPlayground code={`
fun countFactorsOptimized(n: Long): Int {
    var count = 0
    var i = 1L
    while (i * i <= n) {
        if (n % i == 0L) {
            if (n / i == i) {
                count += 1
            } else {
                count += 2
            }
        }
        i++
    }
    return count
}

fun main() {
    val testCases = listOf(12L, 24L, 1000000L, 1000000000L)

    println("| Number      | Optimized Time (s) | Factors |")
    println("|-------------|-------------------|---------|")

    for (n in testCases) {
        val startTime = System.nanoTime()
        val factorCount = countFactorsOptimized(n)
        val endTime = System.nanoTime()

        val executionTime = String.format("%.6f", (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000_000.0)
        println("| %-11s | %-17s | %-7s |".format(n, executionTime, factorCount))
    }
}
`} />

The optimized approach is significantly faster, allowing us to handle much larger numbers efficiently.

### üî∏ Side-by-Side Comparison

Let's compare both approaches directly:

<KotlinPlayground code={`
import java.math.BigInteger

fun countFactorsBruteForce(n: Long): Int {
    var count = 0
    for (i in 1..n) {
        if (n % i == 0L) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}

fun countFactorsOptimized(n: Long): Int {
    var count = 0
    var i = 1L
    while (i * i <= n) {
        if (n % i == 0L) {
            if (n / i == i) {
                count += 1
            } else {
                count += 2
            }
        }
        i++
    }
    return count
}

fun main() {
    val testCases = listOf(12L, 24L, 1000000L)

    println("| Number      | Brute Force Time (s) | Optimized Time (s) | Factors |")
    println("|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|")

    for (n in testCases) {
        // Measure brute force time
        val startBrute = System.nanoTime()
        val factorCount = countFactorsBruteForce(n)
        val endBrute = System.nanoTime()
        val bruteForceTime = String.format("%.6f", (endBrute - startBrute) / 1_000_000_000.0)

        // Measure optimized time
        val startOptimized = System.nanoTime()
        val optimizedCount = countFactorsOptimized(n)
        val endOptimized = System.nanoTime()
        val optimizedTime = String.format("%.6f", (endOptimized - startOptimized) / 1_000_000_000.0)

        println("| %-11s | %-20s | %-17s | %-7s |".format(n, bruteForceTime, optimizedTime, factorCount))
    }

    // For larger numbers, only show optimized approach
    val largeNumber = 1000000000L
    val startOptimized = System.nanoTime()
    val optimizedCount = countFactorsOptimized(largeNumber)
    val endOptimized = System.nanoTime()
    val optimizedTime = String.format("%.6f", (endOptimized - startOptimized) / 1_000_000_000.0)

    println("| %-11s | %-20s | %-17s | %-7s |".format(largeNumber, "Too slow", optimizedTime, optimizedCount))

    // Actual measurement for 10^15 (more practical for demonstration)
    println("| %-11s | %-20s | %-17s | %-7s |".format("10^15", "~100 years", "Calculating...", "-"))

    // Using BigInteger for 10^15 (as 10^18 would take too long even with optimization)

    val veryLargeNumber = BigInteger.TEN.pow(15) // 10^15
    val startVeryLarge = System.nanoTime()

    // Optimized algorithm for BigInteger with efficient implementation
    var count = 0
    var i = BigInteger.ONE
    val zero = BigInteger.ZERO

    // Manual calculation of square root for BigInteger
    // We'll use the fact that sqrt(10^15) = 10^7.5 ‚âà 31,622,776
    val sqrt = BigInteger.valueOf(31622776)

    while (i.compareTo(sqrt) <= 0) {
        if (veryLargeNumber.remainder(i).equals(zero)) {
            val divResult = veryLargeNumber.divide(i)
            if (divResult.equals(i)) {
                count += 1
            } else {
                count += 2
            }
        }
        i = i.add(BigInteger.ONE)
    }

    val endVeryLarge = System.nanoTime()
    val veryLargeTime = String.format("%.6f", (endVeryLarge - startVeryLarge) / 1_000_000_000.0)

    println("| %-11s | %-20s | %-17s | %-7s |".format("10^15", "~100 years", veryLargeTime, count))

    // Note about 10^18
    println("| %-11s | %-20s | %-17s | %-7s |".format("10^18", "~316 years", "~10 seconds*", "-"))
    println("*Estimated based on the O(‚àöN) complexity")
}
`} />

As you can see from the results, the brute force approach quickly becomes impractical as the number grows, while the optimized approach remains efficient even for very large numbers.

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis
- Brute Force Approach: O(N)
- Optimized Approach: O(‚àöN)

For N = 10^15:
- Brute Force: ~100 years (theoretical calculation)
- Optimized: Actual measurement shown in the code above

For N = 10^18:
- Brute Force: ~316 years (theoretical calculation)
- Optimized: ~10 seconds (estimated based on O(‚àöN) complexity)

As you can see from our actual measurements, the optimized approach makes calculations practical that would otherwise take years with the brute force approach. That's the power of optimization! üöÄ
