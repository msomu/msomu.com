# **Brute Force Sudoku Validation: Simple Yet Smart**

_Sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to do exactly what it asks._

Take Sudoku validation: you have a **9x9 grid**, and you need to check if it's valid. But what does "valid" mean?

- **No row** can have duplicate numbers (1-9).
- **No column** can have duplicate numbers.
- **No 3×3 box** (subgrid) can have duplicate numbers.

**How do we check that?** Well, the most direct way is just to check **each condition separately**—one by one. This is a classic **brute-force approach**, but in this case, brute force isn't dumb—it's methodical.

---

## **🚀 Thought Process: Breaking Down the Problem**

Whenever you face a validation problem like this, always **break it down into independent parts**:

1. **Check rows** → Each row should have unique numbers.
2. **Check columns** → Each column should have unique numbers.
3. **Check 3×3 boxes** → Each 3×3 grid should have unique numbers.

Each of these steps is **independent**, meaning we can **solve them separately** and combine the results.

---

## **🛠️ Approach 1: Brute Force (Three-Pass Method)**  
### **Step 1: Validating Rows**
To check rows, we scan each row and use a **hash set** to track numbers. If a number appears twice, it's invalid.

<KotlinPlayground code={`
// check rows
for (i in 0..8) {
    val hashSet = HashSet<Char>()
    for (j in 0..8) {
        if (board[i][j] != '.' && !hashSet.add(board[i][j])) {
            return false
        }
    }
}
`} />

### **Step 2: Validating Columns**
The only change is flipping **(i, j) → (j, i)** to scan columns instead of rows.

<KotlinPlayground code={`
// check columns
for (i in 0..8) {
    val hashSet = HashSet<Char>()
    for (j in 0..8) {
        if (board[j][i] != '.' && !hashSet.add(board[j][i])) {
            return false
        }
    }
}
`} />

### **Step 3: Validating 3×3 Boxes**
This is trickier because **we're not iterating row-wise or column-wise**, but rather in **small 3×3 blocks**.

<KotlinPlayground code={`
// check boxes
for (i in 0..2) {
    for (j in 0..2) {
        val hashSet = HashSet<Char>()
        for (k in 0..2) {
            for (l in 0..2) {
                val num = board[i * 3 + k][j * 3 + l]
                if (num != '.' && !hashSet.add(num)) {
                    return false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
`} />

📌 **Why `i * 3 + k` and `j * 3 + l`?**
This formula maps **each box's coordinates** to the overall grid.

| **Box (i, j)** | **Mapped Grid Range** |
|---------------|---------------------|
| (0,0) | Rows 0-2, Cols 0-2 |
| (0,1) | Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5 |
| (1,0) | Rows 3-5, Cols 0-2 |
| (2,2) | Rows 6-8, Cols 6-8 |

💡 **So far, we have looped over the grid 3 times. Can we do better?**

---

## **⚡ Optimized Approach: One-Pass Validation**

Instead of looping **three times**, what if we check all three conditions **simultaneously** in a **single pass**?

We use **three sets of hash sets**:

- `rowSets[i]` → For the i-th row
- `colSets[j]` → For the j-th column
- `boxSets[boxIndex]` → For the k-th 3×3 box

<KotlinPlayground code={`
val rowSets = Array(9) { HashSet<Char>() }
val colSets = Array(9) { HashSet<Char>() }
val boxSets = Array(9) { HashSet<Char>() }

for (i in 0..8) {
    for (j in 0..8) {
        val num = board[i][j]
        if (num == '.') continue

        val boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3)

        if (num in rowSets[i] || num in colSets[j] || num in boxSets[boxIndex]) {
            return false
        }

        rowSets[i].add(num)
        colSets[j].add(num)
        boxSets[boxIndex].add(num)
    }
}
`} />

**🚀 Why is this faster?**  
✅ **Only one pass over the grid.**  
✅ **No redundant iterations.**  
✅ **Each lookup is O(1) in a set.**  

⏳ **Time Complexity: O(1)** (since it's a fixed 9×9 grid).  
📌 **Space Complexity: O(1)** (three sets of size 9 is negligible).  

---

## **🚀 Ultimate Optimization: Boolean Arrays**
Since Sudoku numbers are **1-9**, we don't need hash sets. A **boolean array** is faster!

<KotlinPlayground code={`
val rows = Array(9) { BooleanArray(9) }
val cols = Array(9) { BooleanArray(9) }
val boxes = Array(9) { BooleanArray(9) }

for (i in 0..8) {
    for (j in 0..8) {
        val num = board[i][j]
        if (num != '.') {
            val index = num - '1'
            val boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + j / 3
            if (rows[i][index] || cols[j][index] || boxes[boxIndex][index]) {
                return false
            }
            rows[i][index] = true
            cols[j][index] = true
            boxes[boxIndex][index] = true
        }
    }
}
`} />

🚀 **Boolean arrays are 2x faster** than sets because:  
✔ **O(1) direct index access** (vs. O(1) hash lookup with extra memory overhead).  
✔ **No hashing required** (direct memory access).

## **📌 Final Thoughts: When to Use Each Approach?**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Brute Force (3 loops)** | Easy to understand, straightforward | Loops over the board 3 times |
| **One-Pass HashSets** | More efficient, single loop | Uses extra space for 3 sets |
| **Boolean Arrays** | Fastest, minimal memory | Slightly harder to read |
