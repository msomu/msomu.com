# Welcome to Think in Code

This is the first post in our new "Think in Code" series, where I'll be documenting what I'm learning in Kotlin. This will be a collection of random topics as I explore the language and improve my coding skills.

## Why Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern programming language that offers many advantages:

1. **Concise and expressive** - Reduce boilerplate code and write more readable solutions
2. **Fully interoperable with Java** - Use existing Java libraries and frameworks seamlessly
3. **Safe by design** - Avoid null pointer exceptions and other common pitfalls

I'll be sharing my learning journey with no specific structure or promises - just daily explorations to become better at coding. All code examples in this series will be exclusively in Kotlin or Java.

<KotlinPlayground code={`
// A simple example of using a list in Kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val sum = numbers.sum()
println("The sum is $sum") // Output: The sum is 15
`} />

Let's embark on this Kotlin learning journey together!
