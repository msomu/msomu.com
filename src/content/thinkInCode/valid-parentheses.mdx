## üß© The Problem: Valid Parentheses

One of the most common and deceptively simple problems on LeetCode is [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/). The task is to check whether a given string of brackets ‚Äî like `()[]{}` ‚Äî is valid, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

It's easy to understand, but solving it in a concise, readable, and safe way requires a bit of finesse. Especially when you're doing it in Kotlin ‚Äî a language that rewards elegant expression.

## ü§î My First Attempt: Functional but Flawed

My first Kotlin version got the job done logically, but there were small mistakes that showed up quickly:

```kotlin
val stack = ArrayDeque(listOf<String>())
```

Oops ‚Äî I used `String` instead of `Char`, which was inefficient.

Then came a deeper issue: I only checked for closing brackets, but forgot to push opening brackets onto the stack. It worked for clean inputs but failed on edge cases ‚Äî and even crashed on others.

These tiny issues reminded me that even for "easy" problems, attention to robustness matters just as much as logic.

## üîç Debugging: Stack Safety and Map Logic

Through some trial and error (and a helpful reminder about `stack.last()` throwing exceptions when empty), I refined the logic:

1. Properly push opening brackets
2. Safely pop from the stack using `removeLastOrNull()`
3. Use a `Map<Char, Char>` instead of `Map<String, String>` for memory and clarity

This version was getting close to idiomatic Kotlin ‚Äî but it still wasn't satisfying.

## ‚ú® The Cleanest Version: Kotlin That Feels Right

After a few tweaks, I landed on a version that struck the perfect balance of safety, readability, and elegance:

<KotlinPlayground hideMain={true} code={`
class Solution {
    fun isValid(s: String): Boolean {
        val pairs = mapOf(')' to '(', '}' to '{', ']' to '[')
        val stack = ArrayDeque<Char>()
        for (c in s) {
            if (c in pairs) {
                if (stack.removeLastOrNull() != pairs[c]) return false
            } else {
                stack.addLast(c)
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val solution = Solution()

    // Example 1
    val s1 = "()[]{}"
    val result1 = solution.isValid(s1)
    println("Example 1:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s1\\"")
    println("Output: \$result1")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are properly matched and in the correct order.")

    // Example 2
    val s2 = "([)]"
    val result2 = solution.isValid(s2)
    println("\\nExample 2:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s2\\"")
    println("Output: \$result2")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are not properly matched - closing brackets must match their most recent opening bracket.")

    // Example 3
    val s3 = "{[]}"
    val result3 = solution.isValid(s3)
    println("\\nExample 3:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s3\\"")
    println("Output: \$result3")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are properly nested and matched.")
}
`} />

What I loved about this version:

‚úÖ Uses `Char` instead of `String`  
‚úÖ Avoids crashes with `removeLastOrNull()`  
‚úÖ Expressive map usage for bracket pairing  
‚úÖ Clean for-in loop over `.forEach` lambda  
‚úÖ Zero clutter ‚Äî just logic that reads like prose  

## üí° What I Learned

Through this process, I picked up some valuable Kotlin idioms and best practices:

1. **Use the Right Types**: Using `Char` instead of `String` for single characters is more memory-efficient and semantically correct.

2. **Safe Operations**: Kotlin provides safe alternatives like `removeLastOrNull()` that prevent runtime exceptions, making your code more robust.

3. **Expressive Collections**: The `in` operator with maps makes code more readable than explicit `contains()` checks.

4. **Simplicity Wins**: Sometimes a straightforward `for` loop is clearer than functional approaches like `.forEach`.

5. **Early Returns**: Using early returns with boolean expressions keeps the code flat and easy to follow.

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis
- Iterating through the string ‚Üí O(N)
- Stack operations (push/pop) ‚Üí O(1)
- Overall Complexity: O(N) üöÄ (Linear time!)

## üß† Key Insights
- A stack is the perfect data structure for this problem because of its LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature
- Mapping closing brackets to their opening counterparts simplifies the logic
- The solution is elegant because it handles all edge cases in a concise way
- Even "easy" problems deserve careful attention to code quality and safety
