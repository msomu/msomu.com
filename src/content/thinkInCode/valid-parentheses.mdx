## 🧩 The Problem: Valid Parentheses

One of the most common and deceptively simple problems on LeetCode is [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/). The task is to check whether a given string of brackets — like `()[]{}` — is valid, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

It's easy to understand, but solving it in a concise, readable, and safe way requires a bit of finesse. Especially when you're doing it in Kotlin — a language that rewards elegant expression.

## 🤔 My First Attempt: Functional but Flawed

My first Kotlin version got the job done logically, but there were small mistakes that showed up quickly:

```kotlin
val stack = ArrayDeque(listOf<String>())
```

Oops — I used `String` instead of `Char`, which was inefficient.

Then came a deeper issue: I only checked for closing brackets, but forgot to push opening brackets onto the stack. It worked for clean inputs but failed on edge cases — and even crashed on others.

These tiny issues reminded me that even for "easy" problems, attention to robustness matters just as much as logic.

---

## 🔍 Debugging: Stack Safety and Map Logic

Through some trial and error (and a helpful reminder about `stack.last()` throwing exceptions when empty), I refined the logic:

1. Properly push opening brackets
2. Safely pop from the stack using `removeLastOrNull()`
3. Use a `Map<Char, Char>` instead of `Map<String, String>` for memory and clarity

This version was getting close to idiomatic Kotlin — but it still wasn't satisfying.

## ✨ The Cleanest Version: Kotlin That Feels Right

After a few tweaks, I landed on a version that struck the perfect balance of safety, readability, and elegance:

<KotlinPlayground hideMain={true} code={`
class Solution {
    fun isValid(s: String): Boolean {
        val pairs = mapOf(')' to '(', '}' to '{', ']' to '[')
        val stack = ArrayDeque<Char>()
        for (c in s) {
            if (c in pairs) {
                if (stack.removeLastOrNull() != pairs[c]) return false
            } else {
                stack.addLast(c)
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val solution = Solution()

    // Example 1
    val s1 = "()[]{}"
    val result1 = solution.isValid(s1)
    println("Example 1:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s1\\"")
    println("Output: \$result1")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are properly matched and in the correct order.")

    // Example 2
    val s2 = "([)]"
    val result2 = solution.isValid(s2)
    println("\\nExample 2:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s2\\"")
    println("Output: \$result2")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are not properly matched - closing brackets must match their most recent opening bracket.")

    // Example 3
    val s3 = "{[]}"
    val result3 = solution.isValid(s3)
    println("\\nExample 3:")
    println("Input: s = \\"\$s3\\"")
    println("Output: \$result3")
    println("Explanation: The brackets are properly nested and matched.")
}
`} />

What I loved about this version:

✅ Uses `Char` instead of `String`  
✅ Avoids crashes with `removeLastOrNull()`  
✅ Expressive map usage for bracket pairing  
✅ Clean for-in loop over `.forEach` lambda  
✅ Zero clutter — just logic that reads like prose  

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this process, I picked up some valuable Kotlin idioms and best practices:

1. **Use the Right Types**: Using `Char` instead of `String` for single characters is more memory-efficient and semantically correct.

2. **Safe Operations**: Kotlin provides safe alternatives like `removeLastOrNull()` that prevent runtime exceptions, making your code more robust.

3. **Expressive Collections**: The `in` operator with maps makes code more readable than explicit `contains()` checks.

4. **Simplicity Wins**: Sometimes a straightforward `for` loop is clearer than functional approaches like `.forEach`.

5. **Early Returns**: Using early returns with boolean expressions keeps the code flat and easy to follow.

## ⏳ Time Complexity Analysis
- Iterating through the string → O(N)
- Stack operations (push/pop) → O(1)
- Overall Complexity: O(N) 🚀 (Linear time!)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- A stack is the perfect data structure for this problem because of its LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature
- Mapping closing brackets to their opening counterparts simplifies the logic
- The solution is elegant because it handles all edge cases in a concise way
- Even "easy" problems deserve careful attention to code quality and safety
