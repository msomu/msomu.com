I'm a Android Developer at [Disney+ Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com), crafting experiences for millions of users across Android and Android TV platforms.

With 10+ years of experience in the mobile ecosystem, I've specialized in:
- Streaming and entertainment applications
- Cross-platform development with KMM
- Build automation and deployment
- Media playback and optimization
- E-commerce solutions
- Ticketing systems

Currently, I'm focusing on building scalable streaming solutions at Disney+ Hotstar, where I work on challenges that impact millions of users daily.

Beyond coding, I'm deeply involved in the Android community. As an active member of [GDG Chennai](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-chennai/), I regularly speak at events and help organize community gatherings to share knowledge and experiences.

My technical journey spans across various domains - from building robust media players to implementing complex e-commerce solutions using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM). I'm passionate about creating efficient, user-centric applications that solve real-world problems.
