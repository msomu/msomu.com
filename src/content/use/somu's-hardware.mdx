## My hardware journey is personal. Here's why:

I name my gadgets. Always have. Each name? A story. A memory. A connection.

Started in 2017. First major purchase: Sony WH-1000XM2. Named it Ethi - inspired by Simbu's character in CCV movie. Still works great.

Every device? Part of the family. Each with its own personality.

The iPad is Lucas for me. 8th Generation. Perfect for sketching. Reading. Learning.

Main workhorse? Hooper. M1 MacBook Air. Named after the Stranger Things character. Does the heavy lifting. Daily
experiments. Coding sessions.

Work companion? Company MacBook Pro. Keeps work separate. Maintains balance.

Phone evolution interesting. Current daily driver? Carte - named after the MIT Workshop where I instructed. Started with Cooper (Nexus 5x), moved through the Pixel family with Chomp, Pam, and Sr. Chomp. Now? Carte continues the pure Android legacy with Pixel 6. Clean experience. Great camera.

Audio matters. Teaching needs quality. Bought Blue Yeti. Named it Yalan. Hey Sinamika reference. Records Droidcon
courses. YouTube content.

## Few things I've learned:

- **Name with meaning.** Each gadget gets a personality. Makes tech personal. Creates connection.
- **Keep memories.** Old devices tell stories. Track progress. Remember journey.
- **Quality matters.** Ethi still works. Good investment lasts.
- **Evolution not revolution.** Started small. Grew thoughtfully. Each addition purposeful.
- **Workspace balance.** Separate work and personal devices. Better boundaries. Clear mind.
- **Audio first.** Good sound changes everything. From Ethi to Yalan. Quality matters.
- **Smart upgrades.** Each new member fills a need. Solves a problem. Adds value.
- **Maintain well.** Take care of them. They take care of you. Regular updates. Clean setup.
- **Purpose driven.** Each device has a role. No unnecessary overlap. Clear function.
- **Document journey.** Name meanings matter. Stories preserved. Memories intact.

Each name? A chapter. Each device? A companion. They shape how I work and live.

Every gadget has a story. Every story matters. Keep collecting. Keep naming. Keep growing.
