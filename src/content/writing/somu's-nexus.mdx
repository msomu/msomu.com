## The Story Behind

When I needed a personal space on the web, I turned to something familiar - a template created by my friend [Sanju](https://github.com/Spikeysanju). His minimalist approach resonated with me. No clutter. Just content that matters.

## Why This Template?

Sometimes the best choices come from trust. Sanju's work has always impressed me with its simplicity. While I'm primarily an Android developer, I appreciate clean design when I see it. This template just clicked.

## Features
- **Uses**: My apps and hardware as tools that shape my work
- **Writings**: Experiences worth sharing, lessons worth remembering
- **More Coming**: Planning to add few more components to match my style

## Tech Behind the Scenes
This site runs on a stack chosen for reliability and simplicity:
- **Astro**: Making static sites simple
- **TailwindCSS**: Clean, consistent styling
- **Markdown**: Writing content feels natural
- **TypeScript**: Keeping code quality high
- **Biome**: Quick formatting and linting
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Smooth deployment

## My Workflow
I keep it simple. Write in Obsidian, commit to git, and watch it go live. The .md format means I can focus on content, not complexity. It's a workflow that fits perfectly with how I think and work.

## Design Philosophy
I believe in uncluttered spaces. While I didn't design this template, I chose it because it reflects what I value - simplicity. No distractions. Just pure content.

## Credits & Recognition
