## The Arc Experiment

### Initial Attraction
[Arc browser](https://arc.net/) emerged as a promising alternative to Chrome, offering innovative features:
- Split screen capabilities
- Dedicated spaces for work, personal, and learning contexts
- Intelligent tab management
- Minimal mouse usage through extensive hotkey support

### The Shortcomings
Despite initial enthusiasm, critical limitations became apparent:
- Significant [battery drain](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/comments/1dx1y3n/arc_is_a_huge_battery_drainer/) during travel
- Reduced development momentum (shifted to maintenance mode) [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9yZ0JusME4)
- Ecosystem integration challenges

## 1Password: The Unexpected Hero

### Beyond Basic Password Management
[1Password](https://1password.com/) transformed from a simple credential storage tool to a comprehensive authentication solution:
- **Passkey Support**: Robust management of modern authentication methods
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Enhanced security features
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Seamless credential access
- **Cost Consideration**: $36-$60/year, depending on family or individual plan

### Migration Motivations
Transitioning from [Google Password Manager](https://passwords.google.com/) revealed significant advantages:
- Enhanced security features
- More comprehensive credential ecosystem
- Better integration across devices and platforms

## Chrome: The Pragmatic Return

### Ecosystem Advantages
Rejoining [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) offered immediate benefits:
- Seamless Android phone integration
- One-tap OTP authentication
- Faster link sharing between mobile and desktop
- Simplified browsing experience

### Missed Arc Features
Noteworthy Arc functionalities left behind:
- **Cmd + Shift + C**: One-click link copying
- Advanced hotkey navigation
- Minimal mouse interaction workflow

## Workflow Philosophy

### Tool Selection Principles
Key learnings from the browser migration:
- Prioritize personal productivity over trending features
- Evaluate tools based on actual workflow, not potential
- Consider ecosystem integration
- Balance between innovation and reliability

## Emerging Alternatives

### [Zen Browser](https://github.com/browserbook/zen-browser): A Cautious Consideration
- Firefox-based engine raised immediate concerns
- Historical issues with media compatibility (e.g., HEVC on macOS)
- Switching browser engines felt like unnecessary complexity
- Strong community and development team, but not compelling enough
- **Decision**: Not ready to migrate, potential future exploration

**Key Hesitation**: Switching from Chromium-based browsers to Firefox's engine seemed like an unnecessary technical risk for marginal gains.

## Technical Reflections

### Browser Selection Criteria
- **Performance**: Battery efficiency
- **Integration**: Cross-device synchronization
- **Usability**: Workflow optimization
- **Security**: Modern authentication support
